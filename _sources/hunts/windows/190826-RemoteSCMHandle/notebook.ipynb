    "# Remote Service Control Manager Handle\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Adversaries might be attempting to open up a handle to the service control manager (SCM) database on remote endpoints to check for local admin access in my environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times, when an adversary lands on an endpoint, the current user does not have local administrator privileges over the compromised system.\n",
    "While some adversaries consider this situation a dead end, others find it very interesting to identify which machines on the network the current user has administrative access to.\n",
    "One common way to accomplish this is by attempting to open up a handle to the service control manager (SCM) database on remote endpoints in the network with SC_MANAGER_ALL_ACCESS (0xF003F) access rights.\n",
    "The Service Control Manager (SCM) is a remote procedure call (RPC) server, so that service configuration and service control programs can manipulate services on remote machines.\n",
    "Only processes with Administrator privileges are able to open a handle to the SCM database.\n",
    "This database is also known as the ServicesActive database.\n",
    "Therefore, it is very effective to check if the current user has administrative or local admin access to other endpoints in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Offensive Tradecraft\n",
    "\n",
    "An adversary can simply use the Win32 API function [OpenSCManagerA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsvc/nf-winsvc-openscmanagera) to attempt to establish a connection to the service control manager (SCM) on the specified computer and open the service control manager database.\n",
    "If this succeeds (A non-zero handle is returned), the current user context has local administrator acess to the remote host.\n",
